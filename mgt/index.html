              SoHara was founded in the Summer of 2025 by Shane Vanderhagen and
              Caleb Messerly. Mr. Shane Vanderhagen is a Co-founder and Chief
              Executive Officer, who received a BS degree in Electrical and
              Computer Engineering (ECE) and is pursuing an MBA at The
              University of Alabama (UA); Mr. Caleb Messerly is a Co-founder and
              Chief Operating Officer, who received an MS degree in CS and is
              pursuing an MBA at UA. Both Shane and Caleb gained hands-on
              experience in power electronics, software development, and
              embedded systems through laboratory research conducted at UA.
              During this work, they were introduced to findings with the
              potential to address the growing challenges stemming from poor
              battery State-of-Health (SoH) estimation.

              In the next 5 years, SoHara’s vision is to become a cornerstone of
              the energy storage system industry and enable battery energy
              storage to be the standard technology used to power America’s
              infrastructure. Through the completion of the outlined technical
              objectives, SoHara will position itself to provide the
              cutting-edge capability of rapid and embedded SoH estimation to
              make this a reality. In achieving this vision, SoHara will impact
              not only the viability of American energy storage systems but also
              the national competitiveness in other downstream concerns,
              including artificial intelligence, grid reliability, and energy
              independence.
