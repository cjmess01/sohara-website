              A Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) is a technology that stores
              electrical energy in rechargeable batteries so it can be used
              later when needed. BESS units take in electricity from the grid or
              renewable sources (like solar or wind), store it chemically, and
              then discharge it back as electrical power to support reliability,
              balance supply and demand, improve power quality, or provide
              backup energy.

              SoHara intends to begin selling to BESS manufacturers and
              integrators throughout the southeast. After a significant base is
              established in the southeast, SoHara will pursue nationwide sales.
            </p>
            <p>
              SoHara began with 2 employees, CEO Shane Vanderhagen and COO Caleb
              Messerly. In partnership with the university through an NSF STTR
              grant, Shane and Caleb will develop a first generation product,
              the Sentinel V1.
            </p>
            <p>
              The principle work of the project in this stage will be research
              and development. Upon creation of a FGP, outsourcing to a
              manufacturing facility will be pursued.

              SoHara is committed to the highest possible quality for its
              customers. To guarantee this, one or more pilot programs will be
              entered with potential customers. These will provide an
              opportunity to field test the Sentinel as well as gain experience
              with integration
